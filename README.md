# ilearn-theme



Overview
========
This directory stores a default theme for ilearn Open edX instance.

We've organized the tree to mimic the directory structure of the edX
codebase so that it's easy to tell where the files will end up upon
deploy. We'll use a special settings file to set the template and
staticfiles paths properly to point to these files.
