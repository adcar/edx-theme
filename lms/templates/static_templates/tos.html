        <p><b>Learning Tree International limits the provision of its educational services to employees of corporations, partnerships and government organizations who are sponsored by their respective organizations. This agreement is between Learning Tree International and the employer.</b></p>
        <p><b>GUARANTEE OF QUALITY</b></p>
        <p>Our Guarantee of Quality provides our customers with the opportunity to attend the course of their choice &mdash; and then pay only if 100% satisfied with the value of the course. If a customer sends us a written notice of dissatisfaction with a course within 60 days of the course start date, the customer will have the option of retaking the course at no charge, applying prepaid tuition fees against another course attendance, or receiving a full refund of any course tuition paid and cancellation of any unpaid invoices for that course. If a customer used a Training Passport, Training Voucher or a Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher for the course, we will not count the attendance against the Training Passport, Training Voucher or Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher used.</p>
        <p><b>TERMS FOR PUBLIC COURSES</b></p>
        <p><span>COURSE TUITION</span></p>
        <p>The course tuition is due and payable within thirty (30) days after the later of the invoice date or the start date of the course with the exception of On-Demand Courses for which tuition must be prepaid prior to attendance or the granting of customer access to the course. Any and all applicable taxes will be invoiced. In the case of Training Passports or Training Vouchers, the full fee for the Training Passport or Training Voucher Pack purchase is due within thirty (30) days after the later of the invoice date or the start date of the first course attended under that Training Passport or Training Voucher Pack purchase. In the case of the Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher Program, payment for each Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. The course tuition includes instruction; course materials; the use of software, computers and other technical hardware as appropriate to the course; and Learning Tree Certification Examinations. ITIL&reg; course attendees that would like to retake their ITIL course or exam must do so within 12 months of the original course date and will not be charged for their retake. If an attendee fails an exam and then two retakes, the attendee must re-attend the course before taking the exam again. Learning Tree International also provides light refreshments during morning and afternoon breaks. The course tuition does not include sleeping rooms, meals, travel or any other expenses that may be incurred by our customer.</p>
        <p><span>SUBSTITUTIONS PERMITTED</span></p>
        <p>We welcome the enrollment of a qualified substitute in an enrollee’s place, provided the customer notifies us in writing before the first day of the course (excludes PRINCE2&reg;, ITIL&reg;, COBIT&reg;, MSP&reg; and Change Management courses). 100% of any prepaid course tuition will be credited against the course tuition fee of the substitute. However, the substitute may not take advantage of any discount program for which he or she is not otherwise qualified. Training Passports are nontransferable and therefore are not eligible for substitution. Substitutions for On-Demand Courses are excluded.</p>
        <p><span>FLEXIBLE TRANSFER/CANCELLATION</span></p>
        <p>If a customer would like to cancel or transfer their course, they must notify Learning Tree prior to two weeks before the start date of the course or within seven days of registration. On-Demand Courses cannot be cancelled once purchased and are not eligible for refund. If a customer transfers to another course prior to two weeks before the start date or within seven days of registration of the course in which originally enrolled, 100% of any prepaid course tuition will be applied toward the course tuition for the subsequent course. If a customer needs to cancel an enrollment two weeks prior to the start of the class or within seven days of registration, we will refund 100% of any prepaid course tuition for that enrollment. If a customer does need to transfer or cancel a course within two weeks of the start date of the course or after seven days from the date of registration, a fee equal to 50% of the price of the course will be assessed for any standard attendances. Attendances associated with a Learning Tree program will be assessed a $500 fee. Training Passports, Training Vouchers and Pay-As-You-Learn Vouchers cannot be used after their expiration dates, and a course cancellation or transfer by the customer will not extend a Training Passport, Training Voucher Pack or Pay-As-You-Learn Voucher Pack expiration date.</p>

        <p>Learning Tree Premium Course is any course that includes 3rd party materials, exam vouchers, certifications, specialized instructors, special software licenses, or premium labs and course kits.

The coaching is done at the workplace as a one-day extension immediately following completion of a Learning Tree On-Site Course.

If a customer purchases a Training Passport and cancels prior to its expiration, we will refund 100% of the difference between the price paid for the Training Passport and the sum of the standard full tuition for each of the courses the customer attended using that Training Passport. Learning Tree reserves the right to exclude certain courses from eligibility in the Passport Program.</p>
        <p><span>TRAINING VOUCHERS PACKS</span></p>
