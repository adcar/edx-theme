            <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active</a>).</p>
        <p>c. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offerings to our users. Google will compile reports, and provide us with insights to other services associated with the online offer which might be of interest to the user.</p>
        <p>d. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.</p>
        <p>e. We use Google Analytics to display the ads placed by Google and its partners (so-called "remarketing" or "Google Analytics Audiences") only to the users that have shown an interest to our online offer, or who have certain characteristics e.g. interests in certain topics or products that are determined by the web pages visited.</p>
        <p>f. We use Google Analytics only with IP anonymization enabled. This means that Google will reduce the IP address of users within Member States of the European Union, or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there.</p>

        <p><b>9. Google-Re/Marketing-Services</b></p>
        <p>a. On the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR) the marketing and remarketing services ("Google Marketing Services" for short) of Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, ("Google").</p>
        <p>b. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (
            <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active</a>).</p>
        <p>c. The Google marketing services allow us to target advertisements to active users, which potentially match their interests. For example, if a user sees an advertisement for a product(s) they have been interested in on other websites, this is referred to as "remarketing". For these purposes, when our and other websites on which Google marketing services are active, Google directly executes a code and (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as "web beacons") are integrated into the website. With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the user's device (comparable technologies can also be used instead of cookies). Cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.comor googleadservices.com. In this file it is noted which websites the user visits, the content viewed, and offers clicked on as a matter of interest, furthermore technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time, and information regarding the use of the online offer. The IP address of the user is also recorded, whereby within the framework of Google Analytics the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union, or in other signatory states of the European Economic Area Agreement. In exceptional cases the IP address is completely transmitted to a Google server in the US where it is then shortened. The IP address is not combined with the user's data within other Google offers. The above information may also be linked by Google to such information from other sources. If the user then visits other websites, the ads are tailored to their interests.</p>
        <p>d. Users' data is processed pseudonymously within the framework of Google marketing services. This means that Google does not store and process, for example, the names or e-mail addresses of users, but processes the relevant data cookie-related within pseudonymous user profiles. This means from Google's point of view, the ads are not managed and displayed for a specifically identifiable person, but for the cookie holder, regardless of who this cookie holder is. This does not apply if a user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymisation. The information collected by Google marketing services is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the US.</p>
        <p>e. Further information on Google's use of data for marketing purposes can be found on the overview page:

        <p>c. When a user calls up a function of this online offer that contains such a plugin, his device establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the user's device and integrated into the online offer. The processed data can be used to create user profiles. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform users according to our level of knowledge.</p>
        <p>d. By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives information that a user has called up the corresponding page of the online offer. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to his Facebook account. When users interact with the plugins, such as pressing the Like button or posting a comment, the information is sent directly from your device to Facebook and stored there.

        <p><b>11. Facebook, Custom Audiences and Facebook Marketing Services</b></p>
        <p>a. Due to our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offer and for these purposes the so-called "Facebook pixel" of the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA, or, if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd, 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland ("Facebook"), is used within our online offer.</p>
        <p>b. Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thus offers a guarantee to comply with European data protection law (
            <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnywAAC&status=Active</a>).</p>
        <p>c. With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine the visitors of our online offer as a target group for the presentation of ads (so-called "Facebook ads"). Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel to display the Facebook ads we post only to Facebook users who have also shown an interest in our online offering or who have certain features (e.g. interests in certain topics or products that are determined by the websites visited) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called "custom audiences"). We also want to use the Facebook pixel to ensure that our Facebook ads meet the potential interest of users and are not a nuisance. The Facebook pixel also helps us understand the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by showing whether users have been redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called "conversion").</p>
        <p>d. The Facebook pixel is integrated directly by Facebook when you visit our website and can store a so-called cookie, i.e. a small file, on your device. If you then log in to Facebook or visit Facebook when logged in, the visit to our online offer will be noted in your profile. The data collected about you is anonymous to us, so it does not provide us with any information about the identity of the user. However, Facebook stores and processes the data so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and can be used by Facebook as well as for its own market research and advertising purposes. If we send data to Facebook for matching purposes, it is encrypted locally by the browser and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection. This is done solely with the purpose of creating a comparison with the data that is equally encrypted by Facebook.</p>
        <p>e. Facebook processes the data in accordance with Facebook's Data Usage Policy. Accordingly, general information on the presentation of Facebook ads can be found in the Facebook Data Usage Policy:
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>. For specific information and details about the Facebook pixel and how it works, please visit the Facebook Help section:

Content of the newsletter(s): We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications containing advertising information (hereinafter "newsletters") only with the consent of the recipient(s), or with legal permission. If the contents of a newsletter are specifically described within the scope of a registration, they describe the extent of the user consent. In addition, our newsletters contain information about our products, offers, promotions and our company / business updates.</p>
        <p>c. Double opt-in and logging: Subscription to our newsletter takes through a double opt-in procedure.

        <p>f. Statistical data collection and analysis - The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the mail order company's server when the newsletter is opened. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are initially collected. This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. The statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is not our intention, nor that of the shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content accordingly, or to send different content in relation to their interests.</p>
        <p>g. The use of the shipping service provider, performance of statistical surveys, analysis, and the registration procedure is conducted on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR. We are interested in using a user-friendly and secure newsletter system that serves both our business interests and the expectations of our recipients.</p>
        <p>h. Cancellation/Revocation - You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. At the same time, your consent to the dispatch by the shipping service provider and the statistical analysis will expire. A separate revocation of the dispatch by the dispatch service provider or the statistical evaluation is unfortunately not possible. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each newsletter. If users have only subscribed to the newsletter and cancelled their subscription, their personal data will be deleted.</p>
        <p id="Integration"><b>13. Integration of third-party services and content</b></p>
        <p>a. We use content or service offers from third parties within our online offering (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) on the basis of our legitimate interests in order to integrate their content and services, e.g. videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").</p>
        <p>b. This always presupposes that the third party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since without the IP address they could not send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required for the display of this content. We make every effort not to use website content, whose provider could use the userâ€™s IP address for other purposes than the transfer of content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. Pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other information about the use of our online offer, as well as may be linked to such information from other sources. c.

The person concerned can prevent the setting of cookies by our website at any time, as already described above, by means of an appropriate setting of the Internet browser used and thus permanently object to the setting of cookies.

        <p>a. Users have the right, upon request and free of charge, to receive information about the personal data that we have stored about them.</p>
        <p>b. In addition, users have the right to correct inaccurate data, to limit the processing and deletion of their personal data, if applicable, to assert their rights to data portability and, in the event of the assumption of unlawful data processing, to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.</p>

        <p id="Deletion"><b>15. Deletion of data</b></p>
        <p>a. The data stored by us will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for its intended purpose and there are no legal obligations to keep it in safekeeping. If the user's data is not deleted because it is necessary for legally permissible purposes, their processing is restricted. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to user data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons.</p>
        <p>b. In accordance with statutory requirements, the records are kept for 6 years in accordance with Â§ 257 (1) HGB (trading books, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual financial statements, commercial letters, accounting documents, etc.) and for 10 years in accordance with Â§ 147 (1) AO (books, records, management reports, accounting documents, commercial and business letters, documents relevant for taxation, etc.)</p>
        <p id="Changes"><b>16. Changes to this Privacy Policy</b></p>
        <p>a. We reserve the right to change the data protection declaration in order to adapt to amended legal circumstances, or in the event of changes to the service or data processing procedure. However, this only applies with regards to declarations on data processing. If a userâ€™s consent is required or components of the data protection declaration contain provisions of the contractual relationship with the users, the changes will only be made with the users' consent.</p>
        <p>b. Users are asked to inform themselves regularly about the contents of the data protection declaration.</p>
        <p id="Right"><b>17. Right of objection</b></p>
        <p>Users can object to any future processing of their personal data in accordance with legal requirements at any time. The objection may be lodged against processing for direct marketing purposes.</p>
