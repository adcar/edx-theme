        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.

        <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. <br> Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>
        <p>Fair Information Practices</p>
        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
        <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
            <br>
            We will notify you via email
        <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
        </ul>
             We will notify the users via in-site notification
        <ul>
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
        <p>CAN SPAM Act</p>
        <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
        <p>
