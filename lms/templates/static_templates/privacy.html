Likewise, from time to time, an Employee’s picture along with Personal Information may be published in the LRS NewsLine. LRS will obtain affirmative consent for such publication from all new Employees before publishing the Employee’s Personal Information. New Employees may decline to provide this consent, and all Employees may withdraw their consent to such publications at any time.")}</p>

Employee information is never sold, leased, or rented to any third party. Employee information will never be disclosed to third parties except as follows: 1) to those retained by LRS for processing only for the purposes set forth above, 2) where required pursuant to an applicable law, governmental or judicial order, law or regulation, or to protect the rights or property of LRS, 3) where authorized in writing by the Employee, 4) where the Employee voluntarily provides Personal Information and the context makes it clear that Employee information will be provided to a third party (ex. LRS Travel Request System profile), 5) US Employee résumés may be provided to Customers or prospective Customers as set forth above, and/or 6) in rare cases, US Employee information will be provided to LRS Consulting Services Customers to use as a personal identifier for legitimate business purposes only and only if LRS has a contractual relationship with the Customer that requires the Customer to protect the information as confidential.")}</p>

Although we do not ever anticipate providing sensitive Personal Information, such as Employee health information, to a non-agent third party or using it for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, we will never do so without first allowing the individual involved to affirmatively and explicitly consent (opt-in) to such transfer or use. The only exception to this choice for both sensitive and non-sensitive Personal Information would be where we are required to disclose your Personal Information pursuant to governmental or judicial order, law, or regulation.")}</p>
